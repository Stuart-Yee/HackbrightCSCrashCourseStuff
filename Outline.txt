Software Development Practices
-- Using git
	branch, pull request, code review, merge
-- SDLC Software Development Lifecycle
	DEV => UAT => PROD

Math (eww!)
-- Functions (represented in Python and in mathematical notation)
-- Signma Notation
-- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/math-symbols/#discrete-mathematics-symbols

Discrete Mathematics 
-- Truth Tables, and/or, not and if, logical arguments and demorgan's laws
-- Set Theory (algebraic and set laws)
-- Bit Arithmetic
-- Boolean Logic and logic gates
-- RSA
-- Graph Theory and circuits
-- Proofs, Strong and Weak Mathematical Induction, Sequences

Calculus
-- Limits
	Energy/Velocity e approaches infinity as it approaches the speed of light
-- Derivatives - slope of a curve
-- Integrals - region under a curve
-- Machine Learning models

Grokking Algorithms
-- Search and Sort Algorithms
-- Hash Functions and Tables
-- Graph Theory
	Djiksra's Algorithm
	Weighted and directional graphs
	

Variables and Memory Management
-- Arrays (why do they start at zero)
-- Pass by Reference versus Pass by Value
-- How it works in C/C++
-- What C/C++ taught me about Python

Networking and Cybersecurity
-- 7 Layers of the OSI Model
-- UDP versus TCP
-- HTTP and HTTPS
-- TCP Handshake and SSL Certificate
-- Tools
	curl
	OpenSSL
	
APIs
-- REST
-- SOAP
-- GraphQL
-- Postman
